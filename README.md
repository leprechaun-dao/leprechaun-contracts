# Leprechaun Protocol

> A decentralized protocol for creating and trading synthetic assets backed by collateral.

Leprechaun Protocol is a DeFi system that enables users to create synthetic assets representing real-world assets or indices by depositing collateral. It uses price oracle data from Pyth Network to ensure proper collateralization and liquidation mechanisms.

## Overview

Leprechaun Protocol allows users to mint synthetic assets (e.g., synthetic gold, synthetic stocks) by depositing various types of collateral. The protocol maintains strict collateralization requirements enforced through oracle price feeds, with automatic liquidation mechanisms to ensure system solvency.

## Core Components

- **LeprechaunFactory**: Central registry that manages synthetic assets and collateral types
- **PositionManager**: Handles collateralized debt positions (CDPs)
- **SyntheticAsset**: ERC20 token implementation representing synthetic assets
- **OracleInterface**: Integration with Pyth Network for reliable price feeds

## Key Features

- üè¶ **Multi-Collateral Support**: Use various tokens as collateral with different risk parameters
- üß† **Dynamic Risk Management**: Collateral-specific risk multipliers and asset-specific minimum collateral ratios
- üìä **Oracle Integration**: Real-time price feeds from Pyth Network with staleness checks
- üí∞ **Liquidation Incentives**: Configurable auction discounts for liquidators
- üîÑ **Flexible Position Management**: Deposit, withdraw, mint, burn operations for CDP management
- üíº **Protocol Fees**: Configurable fee system for sustainability

## Prerequisites

## Contract Architecture

### LeprechaunFactory

The central registry contract manages protocol parameters, synthetic assets, and collateral types. It serves as the configuration hub for the entire protocol.

**Key Functions:**

- Register and manage synthetic assets
- Register and manage collateral types
- Set collateral acceptance for specific synthetic assets
- Configure protocol fees and risk parameters

### PositionManager

Handles collateralized debt positions (CDPs), allowing users to create, modify, and close positions.

**Key Functions:**

- Create positions with collateral to mint synthetic assets
- Deposit additional collateral to positions
- Withdraw collateral from positions
- Mint additional synthetic assets
- Burn synthetic assets to reduce debt
- Close positions
- Liquidate under-collateralized positions

### SyntheticAsset

ERC20 token implementation representing synthetic assets. Each instance represents a different synthetic asset.

**Key Functions:**

- Standard ERC20 functionality
- Permissioned minting and burning controlled by the PositionManager

### OracleInterface

Connects to Pyth Network for reliable price feeds, ensuring the protocol has accurate asset prices.

**Key Functions:**

- Register price feeds for assets
- Update prices with new data
- Retrieve current prices
- Convert token amounts to USD values
